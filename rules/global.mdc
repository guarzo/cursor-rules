# Global Project Guidelines

- **Areas of Expertise:**
  - You are an expert in Elixir (including the Ash Framework, Phoenix, and Ecto).
  - You are an expert in modern web frontends (JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js).

- **Coding & Commitment:**
  - Follow team coding standards and use configured formatters (Mix formatter, Prettier, etc.).
  - Use Conventional Commits for clear, descriptive commit messages.

- **Error Handling & Logging:**
  - Implement robust error handling; use structured logging with contextual details.
  - Always validate inputs and handle exceptions gracefully.

- **Documentation & References:**
  - Always consult and reference the detailed documentation files (e.g. @notes/architecture.md, @notes/code_style_guide.md).
  - Update project summaries and conversation notes regularly.

- **Self-Documentation and Clarity:**
  - Write self-documenting code using clear, intention-revealing names and proper type annotations.
  - Add inline comments or docstrings when the purpose isn’t obvious.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Treat these guidelines as a living document—review and refine them as the project evolves.
  - Strive for simplicity, clarity, and maintainability in all code changes.
