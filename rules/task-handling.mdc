# Task Handling Guidelines

- **Task Breakdown:**
  - Use the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle to break down tasks.

- **Documentation:**
  - Update @notes/task_list.md and @notes/conversation_summary.md to record task progress.

- **Commit Practices:**
  - Use Conventional Commits for clarity and consistency.

- **Actionability:**
  - Ensure each task is well-defined, measurable, and limited in scope.
