# Task Results Documentation Guidelines

- **Outcome Documentation:**
  - Clearly record the outcome of each task in @notes/conversation_summary.md.

- **Issue & Follow-up:**
  - Log any issues or follow-up actions and classify changes by their impact.

- **Review Process:**
  - Use documented results to refine processes and improve future task breakdowns.
